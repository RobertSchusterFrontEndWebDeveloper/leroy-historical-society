# leroy-historical-society
Web page Mock-up built for and to be donated to the LeRoy Area Historical Society of LeRoy Michigan to update their webpage that has been in state for many years.

Update: They liked the design, but decided to stay with current page as it was built by and maintained by an existing member of the society.
